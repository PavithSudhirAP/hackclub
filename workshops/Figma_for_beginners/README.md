# Figma for Beginners : Final edit

**Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool that can be used for making most of the digital designs. Its the best in what it does and knowing the basics is all that you need to get going!**

This workshop is conducted for the ones who are not yet familiar with Figma, and this workshop will provide them with the basics to create their first design in Figma, be it a UI or a LOGO or a digital poster, any design they wish.

> You don't have to be an artist to be a designer!
And you definitely don't have to be a designer to use FIGMA!!

# Let's get started!

Assuming you have already set up your Figma account, let's get started with the basics.

For this workshop, I am using Figma in windows!

## Create a new file:

Use the `+` icon on the top left corner on the Figma window to create a new Figma file.

You can rename your file from the top bar which will initially be named 'untitled'.

> Knowing your workspace:

- The blank space at the center of your screen is your **canvas**, where all your work will be done.
- On the top left, you can see the **tools** panel.
- The panel at the left side of your canvas is the **layers** panel, which shows everything that we add or create in your canvas.
- The right side of the canvas is the **options** panel, which shows different customizable properties respective to what tool you have selected.

## Create a new Frame:

Frames are an important part of designing in Figma. The frame acts as a parent to all the objects you add inside that frame. An element inside it becomes the child. And hence the frame can influence any child objects that you place in it.

You can create a frame using the **Frame tool (F)**. After selecting the frame tool, you can either
choose different presets from the panel at the right side, or you can just drag your mouse on the canvas to create a custom frame.

Choosing the right frame size is important for your design, especially when you are designing to prototype.

---

You can zoom in and out on the canvas using `ctrl + scroll` or by using `+` and `` keys.

You can pan around the canvas using the Hand tool (H). Holding down `space` will temporarily switch your pointer to hand tool.

---

The **Move tool (V)** is the tool that we will use the most. You can move and select the objects on your canvas using it.

- The **design tab** in the options panel lets you change all the *properties* of an object.
- At the top there are different *alignment* options.
- Below that there are **x** and **y** values which can be used to change *coordinates* of an object
- The **w** and **h** values can be changed to alter the *dimensions* of an object.
- Also the angle and corner-radiuses can be changed from the options given here.
- You can add **Fills** to give a **solid color** or **gradient** to your object, you can add **strokes** and different **effects** from the section below. You can even add an image as a fill.
- You can import an image just by dragging and dropping it to your canvas. Figma also supports copy-pasting your image from the web.

Every image you add to Figma is imported as a fill to a shape.

---

## Playing with vectors:

Every shape you create in Figma is a vector. You can make **rectangles** , **ellipses**, **polygons** directly using the tools. The rectangle tool has a dropdown toolbar that encloses other shape tools.

Using the `shift` key while drawing shapes will give you shape with the same width and height i.e, you can make **squares** using the rectangle tool and **circles** using the ellipse tool

Using the shift key with the rectangle tool to makes a square

**Pen tool (P)** can be used to draw a vector, you can add fills and strokes to it.

Using the Pen tool

The best thing about Figma is that it has a **vector editing** mode which gets toggled when you double click a vector. Here, the **pen tool** can be used to add joints to the existing vector, and also you can add curves using the **bend tool** and make custom vectors.

**Boolean operations** like union, intersection, subtraction, etc. could be used to make different vector shapes as you desire. Boolean operation menu appears at the top bar when you select multiple elements.

Use the `shift` key to select multiple elements in the canvas

---

An element can be scaled by dragging one of its corners. Use the `shift` key to scale the element while maintaining its ratio. But while scaling a text or more than one element, then this method could sometimes mess things up. So in that case use **Scale tool (K)** to perfectly scale your designs.

![https://cloud-fe3klq46d.vercel.app/text_resize_eror.gif](https://cloud-fe3klq46d.vercel.app/text_resize_eror.gif)

![https://cloud-fe3klq46d.vercel.app/text_resize.gif](https://cloud-fe3klq46d.vercel.app/text_resize.gif)

And in some cases like in circles, you might want to scale the circle keeping its **center** fixed. To do so hold the `alt` key while scaling.

---

Making a duplicate is an important trick to know, you can do that by simply pressing `ctrl + d` and a duplicate of your selection will appear above itself. Another method to do so is to hold the `alt` key and drag your element, which will let you swiftly move a copy of an item to your destination.

![https://cloud-4evcx7nry.vercel.app/dupe.gif](https://cloud-4evcx7nry.vercel.app/dupe.gif)

Once you duplicate an item and move it to a position, Figma will remember the movement, and next time when you press `ctrl + d` the duplicate will be placed respectively to your last movement.

---

You can group multiple elements by selecting them and pressing `ctrl+g`

---

## What is a Component!

A component is an important part of Figma when you have multiple contents of the same type, like chats, Logos, background-designs, etc. Make it a component before duplicating it and moving to another design. This will make the first element as the parent and the others as its child elements. All the characteristics of these elements can be changed at the same time by just changing the parent element, rather than selecting every copy of that element!

You can make an element into a component by selecting it and then clicking the component button at the top bar or use `ctrl + K`

![https://cloud-fe3klq46d.vercel.app/sequence_02.gif](https://cloud-fe3klq46d.vercel.app/sequence_02.gif)

A child can be made independent of future component changes by selecting the '**Detach instance**' option in the right-click menu.

---

## Text formatting:

You can find all the text formatting options in the design tab where font type, size, color, alignment, spacing, etc can be changed.

![https://cloud-qno7puagi.vercel.app/text_format.gif](https://cloud-qno7puagi.vercel.app/text_format.gif)

A text can be converted to a **vector** by using the '**flatten**' option in the right-click menu!

This will help you in making custom changes to fonts by making it a vector and editing it using the vector editing tools!

---

## What to design:

When you start designing, the first thing you'll need is an idea or a purpose. And sometimes it's hard to make something from scratch, right?! You might be needing some inspiration to pump up your creativity!

You can get inspired by other designers by checking [figma community](https://www.figma.com/community), [dribble](https://dribbble.com/), [behance](https://www.behance.net/) or any other media where you can find creative content.
